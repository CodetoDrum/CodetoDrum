- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodetoDrum
- 👀 I’m interested in the R programming language and extending data management best practices to the environmental field.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about creating my own R functions, leveraging iteration packages such as purrr, and hopefully how to create and manage my own packages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any form of data-centered project. How to set up better ETL processes, manage data, and leverage R for better analytics.
- 📫 How to reach me: Here on GitHub for now.
